            <p>The term "asset" is used often, and has many different meanings in different
               industries and even in different areas of the same production facility. In TACTIC, an
                           asset is an <span class="italic">atomic entity</span> with metadata and files
                           associated with it. To avoid confusion, the TACTIC assets are called "searchable
                           objects," shortened to <span class="italic">sObjects</span>. 
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="simplesect" title="sObjects">
            <div class="titlepage">
               <div>
                  <div>
                     <h4 class="title"><a name="d0e24"></a>sObjects
                     </h4>
                  </div>
               </div>
            </div>
            <p>sObjects are the atomic entities (or assets) that TACTIC uses to manipulate data and
                           check in files. An sObject can be any entity required in a production. Examples of
                           sObjects include shots, textures, users, tasks, production notes, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>Every sObject must belong to a search type, also known as sType. <span class="italic">Search types</span> are a set of unique string entities that serve
                           to classify all variations of sObjects. Search types are registered in the
                           "search_object" table in the "sthpw" database. This table defines the properties for
                           each search type, and is used to ensure that sObjects adheres to their search type
                           properties. For instance, in a custom project, you may have a custom/shot sType created
                           for shot. Once it's registered, you can add shot entries in the shot table that it
                           generates. The shot entries are the shot sObjects.
            </p>
            <p>It is technically possible to store data on assets anywhere, but the TACTIC approach
                           is to use an SQL database so sObject data can be tracked in the database and rules can
                           be enforced. In TACTIC, each sObject is represented as a table in the database. All
                           sObjects for your project are stored in a project-wide database and cross-project
                           sObjects (for example, those related to users) are stored in the main TACTIC database
                           "sthpw."
