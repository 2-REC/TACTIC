            <p>TACTIC has a default file
               naming convention that has proven to work for a wide variety of productions. A
               production facility may simply choose to use this default naming convention, or could
               also override it to match the convention used by its current system. Customizing the
               directory and file naming conventions has proven to be the most time consuming part of
               integrating TACTIC into a system. The difficulty required to do this depends largely on
                           being able to access the directories and file names procedurally. 
            </p>
            <p>TACTIC
                           allows you to define different project types in the Site Admin -&gt; Projects Types View.
                           Here you can define a different type of project and set up the various types of naming
                           conventions for a particular project. When creating a project, you select a project type
                           and it will make use of the information in the project type. 
            </p>
            <p>The various
                           naming conventionn are as follows: 
            </p>
            <div class="orderedlist">
               <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">

            </div> The following code snippet is an example of overriding the directory for all
                    files checked into a shot:
                        <pre class="programlisting">from pyasm.prod.biz import ProdDirNaming

class CustomDirNaming(ProdDirNaming):
    def prod_shot(my, dirs):

        shot = my.sobject
                
        dirs = my.get_base_dir()
                
        # add the sequence code
        sequence_code = shot.get_value("sequence_code")
        dirs.append(sequence_code)
                
        # add the shot code
        shot_code = shot.get_code()
        dirs.append(shot_code)
                
        # put all files in the "scenes" directory
        dirs.append("scenes")
                
        return dirs
        </pre><p>This
                           will create a directory name that looks something like
            </p>
            <p>
                           <code class="code">/&lt;base_dir&gt;/&lt;sequence_code&gt;/&lt;shot_code&gt;/scenes</code>
                       
            </p>
            <p>or</p>
            <p> /sample3d/shot/XG/XG002/scenes</p>
            <p>Overriding naming
                           conventions is a simple matter of defining your own implementation class and
                           implementing specific functions in this class. Each SObject has its own SObject type.
                           For example a shot in a production may have the type "prod/shot". This naming uniquely
                           identifies this type of SObject.
            </p>
            <p>To customize the naming convention for this
                           class, you replace the slashes "/" in the Search Type with underscores "_" and use this
                           as the name of the function. So in the example above, to customize a Shot (prod/shot),
                           you define a function called prod_shot. Whenever TACTIC is asked to produce a directory
                           for a particular SObject, an implementation function such as this is called. If no such
                           function exists, then the default is used.
            </p>
            <p>get_base_dir() simply gets the
                           base directory of this SObject (default &lt;base&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/&lt;table&gt;)
                           
            </p>
            <p>Overriding the file naming is
                           similar.
            </p><pre class="programlisting">from pyasm.prod.biz import ProdFileNaming

    def prod_shot(my):

        parts = []
                
        parts.append(my.sobject.get_code())

            <p>Custom in this case is a custom attribute added to a shot. So with these two

            <p>TACTIC comes with a default file and directory naming convention. You may choose to
                           adopt this default naming convention as specified above, or you may create your own
                           naming convention. The choice of which naming conventions should be used is often a hard
                           one. Using TACTIC's default naming convention makes it much simpler and quicker to start
                           using TACTIC in production. This is the recommended route if there is no legacy within
                           the facility. If, however, you have many scripts and processes that rely on a previous
                           naming convention, then you may customize TACTIC to map to your current naming
                           convention.
            </p>
            <p>The rest of this section describes TACTIC's default naming conventions.</p>
            <p>To start, there is a base directory under which all asset files are stored. This base
                           directory is specified in the Tactic conf file in
                           &lt;sites_dir&gt;/config/tactic_linux.conf (tactic_win32.conf for windows). The next level
                           is divided by project and then the type of the sobject. All projects of this same type
                           are located under this directory:
            </p>
            <p>
                           <code class="code">&lt;base_asset_dir&gt;</code>
                       
            </p>
            <p>The default for any search type checked into a specific context is represented with
                           the following convention:
            </p>
            <p>The next levels represent the subdirectory component and are all associated with
                           metadata for the SObject types in some way. The details are up to the implementation
                           function for each specific SObject type.
            </p><pre class="screen">&lt;base_asset_dir&gt;/&lt;project_code&gt;/&lt;search_type&gt;/&lt;sobject_code&gt;/&lt;sobject_code&gt;_&lt;snapshot_context&gt;_&lt;snapshot_version&gt;.&lt;original_file_ext&gt;</pre><p>
                           <span class="bold"><strong>Default</strong></span>
                       
            </p>
            <p>If an SObject type does not have any overriding function, then there is a default
                           implementation:
            </p>
            <p>Subdir: empty File: &lt;filename&gt;_&lt;file_code&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;</p><pre class="programlisting">    Subdir: empty

    File: &lt;filename&gt;_&lt;file_code&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;

    example: /home/apache/assets/storyboard/castle01_00034355BAR.jpg
        </pre><p>The file code ensures that the file name is unique. This uniqueness prevents files
                           from overwriting each other, even when files of the same name are checked in. In recent
                           versions TACTIC has moved away from adding the file code to the file name in favor of
                           the clearer v002_BAR ending. (However, the file name format can still exist for numerous
                           asset types where the file name is of little consequence.)
