         <p>Triggers are callbacks that are named based on certain events. TACTIC provides three types
            of triggers which allow you to add to existing functionality.

            <p>As TACTIC runs through its code, it will periodically call named events. These named
                           events provide a mechanism for attaching custom trigger handlers.
            </p>
            <p>There are two styles of named event triggers supported by TACTIC.</p>
            <p>The first style of event-based trigger makes use of the client API. The functionality
                           in the client API can be accessed by the server code and is often preferable for third
                           parties to use because it uses a well-defined interface much easier to program in than
                           the complex server code. To create your own custom trigger, create a new class derived
                           from the Handler class and override the execute function:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">from tactic_client_lib import TacticServerStub
from tactic_client_lib.interpreter import Handler

class CustomTrigger(Handler):
    def execute(my):
        # get a handle to the server stub
        server = TacticServerStub.get()
        server.start("Starting server transaction")
        try:
            # at this point, you have full access to the server using the client API
            ret_val = server.ping()

            # get values from the inputs
            search_key = my.get_input_value("search_key")
            sobject = server.get_by_search_key(search_key)
            if sobject.get('asset_library') != 'character':
                return

            # check to see that the status has changed
            update_data = my.get_input_value("update_data")
            if update_data.get('status'):
                do_something_interesting(sobject)

        except:
            server.abort()
        else:
            server.finish()</pre><p>A reference to the TacticServerStub can be accessed through the static method get().
                           Once a reference to the server stub is obtained, it is possible to make use of the
                           client API functionality. The main difference is that this code is being run inside the
                           TACTIC server process, so the overhead of XMLRPC is not present. Thus triggers running
                           on the server side will run much faster that those running using the XMLRPC
                           protocol.
            </p>
            <p>It is also possible in the trigger to access another TACTIC server by using the
                           TacticServerStub and explicitly setting the three settings required to connect to
                           another server. For example, here is some code to synchronize the asset list:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">    server = TacticServerStub()
    server.set_server("tactic2.com")
    server.set_ticket(ticket)
    server.set_project(project)
    server.start("Synchonizing data")
    try:
        search_key = my.get_input_value("search_key")
        update_data = my.get_input_value("update_data")
        server.update(search_key, update_data)
    except:
        server.abort()
    else:
        server.finish()</pre><p>Synchronization of data between two TACTIC servers is possible once authentication is
                           set up. (Note that some priviledged knowledge about the remote server is required in
                           order to authenticate.) 
            </p>
            <p>The second style of event-based trigger is driven from the class pyasm.command:</p><pre class="programlisting">from pyasm.command import Trigger
class CustomTrigger(Trigger):
    def execute(my):
         print "executing custom trigger"</pre><p>This trigger style makes use of server-side code and is much more complex to use. It
                           is most often used internally and should generally not be used unless required due to a
                           limitation in the client API.
