         </h3>
         <p>TACTIC manages two aspects of Digital Content Management: Project data and Files. TACTIC
                    maintains both of these components in one unified source.

                     <td>Project Data is the information and lists that are traditionally tracked
                        in spreadsheets. TACTIC has the ability to list all files you manage along
                                                with task assignments, status', and scheduling data, which can be viewed in
                                                simple table formats or complex custom reports. TACTIC eliminates lost email
                                                threads, missing documents, and the need to update complex spreadsheets. The
                                                "database" is the base location for all data. i.e. notes, reports, schedules
                                                etc. What a database provides is a central location for this
                                                information.

                                                       along with proper version control is what makes TACTIC unique. Files in
                                                       TACTIC are managed externally in a file system. i.e. hard drive. The
                                                       file server typically has a root 'assets' directory. From this location,
                                                       TACTIC handles the filenames and directories for that file system.

         </h3>
         <p>End-Users have various roles within a project or organization. The TACTIC interface can be
                    moulded to provide each group (department) with the ideal interface. 
         </p>
         <p>The TACTIC security architecture is a rules-based system where each End-User is provided
                    with a login. The End-User is assigned to groups determined by the project leader or
                    administrator. These rules determine what the End-User has access to within TACTIC.
         </p>
         <p>Communication between groups and departments can be tracked in real-time by using the
                    TACTIC Notes functionality. This method eliminates lost email threads and misplaced
                    documents. 
         </p>
         <p>TACTIC can manage limitless amount of tasks, the status of those tasks and the location of
                    all files being managed. TACTIC gives the End-User an accurate real-time understanding of
                    how a project is progressing.

         <p>The table below illustrates how various
                    End-Users may interact with TACTIC in a single organization.

                                                TACTIC's built in web technology allows Clients to deliver files and provide
                                                real-time feedback without FTP or Email. TACTIC can provide Clients with

         <p>Accessing TACTIC is as simple as visiting your server's address (URL) in your web browser.
                    For example:
