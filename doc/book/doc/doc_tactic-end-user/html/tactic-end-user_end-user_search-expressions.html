         </h4>
         <p>The search criteria input for search filters can be TACTIC expressions. To signify to
            TACTIC that a search criteria is an expression, wrap the expression in curly braces {}. This
            signifies to the search engine to evaluate the value as an expression before sending it to
                    the search.
         </p>
         <p>Having the search criteria be a TACTIC expression allows for many uses of predefined
                    variables in the expression language.
         </p>
         <p>For example, the following will search for all tasks for this week based on a Sunday to
                    Sunday work week.
         </p><pre class="screen">timestamp "is after" "{$PREV_SUNDAY}"
timestamp "is before" "{$NEXT_SUNDAY}"</pre><p>Here is the TACTIC expression to find all of the checkins that have occurred this
                    month:
         </p><pre class="screen">timestamp "is after" "{$THIS_MONTH}"</pre><p>Here is the TACTIC expression to find all the tasks for the current project:</p><pre class="screen">project_code "is" "{$PROJECT}"</pre><p>Note: the curly braces {} around these predefined variables are not needed in the
                    expression mode described below.
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e1810"></a>Full Expression searches
         </h4>
         <p>Full expressions searches are an advanced way of searching for results. For each column,
                    there is an "**expression" option. This option provides the ability to use the full power of
                    the expression language within a search that are beyond the capabilities of the search user
                    interface.
         </p>
         <p>The full expression executes an evaluation on this expression then relates the results to
                    the main search. Careful consideration must be take to refine an expressions so that is as
                    efficient as possible.
         </p>
         <p>For example, search for all of the assets that have model tasks:</p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(sthpw/task['context','model'])</pre><p>This search will first execute a search of all of the tasks that have model. Note that
                    this does a search on all of the modelling tasks. With a large number of tasks, this
                    operation can be heavy. Care must be taken to minimize the results of the expression. One
                    way to make the search more efficient is limit the search to just that of the current
                    project:
         </p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(sthpw/task['project_code',$PROJECT]['context','model'])</pre><p>The expressions can be combined with other filters in any combination so that very complex
                    searches can be achieved.
         </p>
         <p>For example, another more complex search is to find all items with a modelling task
                    assigned to someone in the "toronto" location (assuming there is a custom property on the
                    login table), we can use:
         </p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(sthpw/login['location','toronto'].sthpw/task['project_code',$PROJECT]['context','model'])</pre><p>This works because tasks (sthpw/task) and logins (sthpw/login) are connected through each
                    other through the "assigned" column in the task table and "login" column in the login table.
         </p>
         <p>There are 4 modes available to the expression search: "have", "do not have", "match", "do
                    not match". These four searches can be applied to the Shot List page.

                                         items that have more than 3 snapshots. This mode must return True or False in
                                         the expression.

                                         In other words, it means there is at least 1 or more model check-in for the
                                         shot. This mode must return True or False in the expression.
