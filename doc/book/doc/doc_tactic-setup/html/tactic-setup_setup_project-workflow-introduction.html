         <p>The <span class="bold"><strong>pipeline</strong></span> defines all of the processes and
            deliverables required in the creation of an item, and is the central entity that ties the
            whole production together. In simple terms, a pipeline is simply a definition of workflow
                    processes. 
         </p>
         <p>In TACTIC, the pipeline workflow is used to lay out the steps which a particular
            Searchable Type (sType) needs to follow as it flows through its processes. Searchable
            Objects (sObjects) in TACTIC are by nature like static containers or place holders that
            contain everything that relates to them. When this content needs to be organized, managed
            and produced as a part of a workflow, this is where a pipeline comes into play. A Pipeline
            allows for this item "container" to be placed on a digital conveyor belt where it will stop
                    at each process and will be filled with Tasks, Notes, Snapshots (checked in files) and more.
                    On top of this, the contents are tagged with this process allowing for a separate history
                    representing each stop on the conveyor belt.

         <h4><a name="d0e4886"></a>Workflow Concepts
         </h4>
         <p>At the very beginning, a clear diagram should be defined of the processes, their
                    relationships to each other and the deliverables between each of the processes.
         </p>
         <p>Each <span class="bold"><strong>sType</strong></span> can have its own pipeline(s), so you create
                    different pipelines for different sTypes.
         </p>
         <p>The best approach to building a pipeline is to start simple, processes can always be added
                    later. Overall, the general concept for defining the processes in a pipeline, is to break
                    down each place where separate file versioning, tasks and notes will need to be generated
                    and tracked
         </p>
         <p>Simply put: you have a series of processes, named in any way you wish. Each process is
                    often represented by a task assigned to a user which needs to be worked on. The completion
                    of a process occurs when this task complete (often indicated by setting it to a final status
                    ie approved, complete etc). While this task is in progress, files will be checked in and
                    notes will be tracked as the process is worked on.
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e4899"></a>Status
         </h4>
         <p>Each process also contains a set of possible "statuses" which which typically a used by
                    the tasks. For example the "model" process can have a possible status of (Waiting, Ready, In
                    Progress, Revise, Review, Approved, Client approved). Each status helps track the current
                    state of the process and are often the spawning point of automatically setting downstream
                    and upstream process status, sending automated notifications and using the python triggers,
                    etc.
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e4903"></a>Subcontext (advanced)
         </h4>
         <p>At times there may need to be a further breakdown within a process, this can be achieved
                    through using a <span class="bold"><strong>subcontext</strong></span>. Sub-contexts are used for
                    departments to check-in and track work and progress internally without other departments
                    needing to interact withe the content. For example, in the case of a VFX process in a shot
                    pipeline, someone checking in files may be able to add extra specification (subcontext) such
                    as VFX/dynamics, VFX/water, or VFX/smoke.  Another situation is where multiple variation of
                    something need to be checked in.  For example you may need a "red" and a "blue" design so
                    the subcontexts for a design checkin would be design/red and desing/blue.
