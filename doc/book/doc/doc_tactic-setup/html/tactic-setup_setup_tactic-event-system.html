         <p>The TACTIC Event System is built into the base transactional system in Tactic's core.
            Every transaction which occurs in Tactic can fire an event which in turn, can be used to
                    execute a trigger or notification. 
         </p>
         <p>These events can be incorporated to automate specific processes that are often repetitive.
            At the simplest level, there are interfaces that help prepare and configure these aspects
                    but, it is good to understand how they work. Overall, there are 2 levels that these events
                    can be configured. The first is using the predefined event options provided in the Project
                    Workflow or Project Schema interfaces and the second in the low level database
                    events.
         </p>
         <h5><a name="d0e5466"></a>Predefined Events
         </h5>
         <p>The following list of events are the events provided in the Project Workflow interface.
                    For more information in setting up Notifications and Triggers with this interface, please
                    refer to <span class="bold"><strong>Project Automation - Triggers</strong></span> and <span class="bold"><strong>Project Automation - Notifications</strong></span></p>
