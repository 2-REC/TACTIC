</li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>What Makes TACTIC Scalable?</strong></span></p><p>The TACTIC platform uses web technologies in its underlying
architecture. As proven by many popular web sites today, web
technologies are able to scale to a large number of users—to levels far
beyond the size of any large installation today requiring TACTIC.</p><p>The TACTIC user interface and its API (Application Programmer Interface)
are both built on web technologies. A web server controls as the user
front end., and accesses a back-end database. Web servers can handle
high volumes, so scalability is not an issue—especially for the
relatively manageable volume seen in even the largest of digital
productions.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Web server technology</strong></span></p><p>TACTIC uses a web server to deliver static content to users, who are
able to access TACTIC over the web. Web servers are capable of
delivering enormous numbers of requests, and will remain stable during
heavy loads. Web servers by definition are the most efficient vehicles
for web delivery, and TACTIC technology is optimized to take advantage
of this technology for fast execution and scalability.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Leading database technology</strong></span></p><p>TACTIC stores all persistent data in either Oracle or PostgreSQL
databases, products that both have proven track records in the most
demanding of production environments.</p><p>Today’s databases coupled with today’s hardware are sufficiently
powerful to handle any of today’s production needs. The largest of
digital productions cannot come close to exceeding the data limits of a
typical database.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Optimized requests</strong></span></p><p>With digital productions, the amount of data required is seldom the
issue. Rather, bottlenecks are typically caused by complex requests
slowing down database response time. Digital productions tend to use
deeply nested and enormously complex relationships between various
pieces of data. It is this complexity that tends to slow down
applications that try to parse this data in a meaningful human way,
creating complex requests that slow down database response.</p><p>TACTIC is designed from the ground up to master the complexities of
digital productions. For every request, it builds a unique
object-relational mapper specifically designed for the needs of high
volume, large scale digital production asset management solutions.</p><p>TACTIC is flexible enough to handle the complex relationships between
any part of the production pipeline, and has proven itself in
large-scale projects using extremely complex data.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Easy code maintenance</strong></span></p><p>The Python programming language is used for TACTIC application
development. Python has many strengths that contribute to ease of
maintenance (courtesy of www.python.org):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

</li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Load balancing</strong></span></p><p>Load balancing—the distribution of requests across TACTIC processes—is
possible across cores and across multiple machines, and enables TACTIC
to scale to large enterprise environments.</p><p>(For details and examples, see <span class="strong"><strong>TACTIC Scalable Configuration
Examples</strong></span>.)</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Segregating services</strong></span></p><p>The various TACTIC services can be segregated to run independently of
each other. This allows important services, such as user interface
requests, to access their own resources and not be slowed down by other
more resource-intensive services such as render farms.</p><p>(For details and examples, see <span class="strong"><strong>Scalable TACTIC Deployments</strong></span>.)</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Types of Scalability</strong></span></p><p>There are several types of scalability that are considerations with the
use of Python as the TACTIC programming language:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
Code scalability: TACTIC contains thousands of classes and many
hundreds of thousands of lines of code which are facilitated by use of
the Python language. There has been no reason to believe that the code
base cannot continue to scale to meet software needs for the foreseeable
future.
</li><li class="listitem">
Memory scalability: Python is known for large memory requirements when
compared to other languages, but the required memory for TACTIC code is
much smaller than that found on typical servers, and has seldom been an
issue.
</li><li class="listitem">
Performance scalability: Python’s GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limits
Python’s scalability across multiple threads. This limitation has been
long discussed in newsgroups, with the general consensus that
scalability is achieved much more easily by load-balancing across
processes rather than across threads. TACTIC enables easy load balancing
across processes to achieve full linear scalability.
</li><li class="listitem">
Maintenance scalability: Clean and clear syntax makes it easy to
refactor and maintain code over the long term. Experience has shown that
our code base is very accessible to new developers, providing confidence
that code base knowledge can be maintained over the years.
</li></ul></div><p>Overall, very few limitations with the Python language itself have been
encountered and have easily circumvented its lack of scalability across
multiple threads by optimizing proper load balancing across processes.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Additional Scalability Considerations</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Availability</strong></span></p><p>TACTIC has been designed to be highly stable even under extremely heavy
stress. It has been tested and tuned on several projects in environments
of high stress and high load and has been proven to run under duress
without going down.</p><p>As with any piece of software, there is always a point a failure—there
are a number of legitimate reasons for a TACTIC server becoming
unresponsive or even going down:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
network cutoff
</li><li class="listitem">
power failure
</li><li class="listitem">
physical memory failure
</li><li class="listitem">
overloaded requests for the available resources
</li></ul></div><p>For projects that require high availability even in the event of
catastrophic failure, there are a number of hardware solutions to
provide failover should the primary resource fail. These hardware
solutions will instantly redirect requests to a redundant resource,
thereby providing continuous service to the users.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Memory requirements</strong></span></p><p>Each available process will use a certain amount of memory, so a balance
must be struck between the number of processes and the size of the
complete in-memory TACTIC footprint on the server. In other words,
adding more processes may or may not increase the availability of TACTIC
if memory is an issue. If processes start running into swap space,
performance will be severely affected.</p><p>As memory usage becomes an issue, the choice will be to load balance
over multiple machines (see <span class="strong"><strong>Scalable TACTIC Deployments</strong></span>).</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Database Replication</strong></span></p><p>Both Oracle and Postgres have replication capability: the ability to
distribute the processing load of the database server over a number of
machines. Database replication is complex and should not be taken
lightly. With the advent of multiprocessor and multi-cores systems, the
need for database replication has been reduced significantly. It is
often much cheaper and less time consuming to increase the
processors/cores of a server than it is to configure a database for
replication.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
