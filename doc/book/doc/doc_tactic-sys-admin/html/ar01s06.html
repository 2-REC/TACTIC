compromised, even with rigorous security testing. TACTIC, in its current
version, has not been production tested for security scenarios outside
of completely trusted networks like intranets. This document does not
make any claims that TACTIC has any level of security beyond what its
current architecture design allows.</p><p>TACTIC is a bandwidth-intensive application, and client-server
performance will be affected by any number of network issues between the
client and the server.</p><p>There are numerous elements of functionality that go beyond utilizing
HTTP port access in enterprise applications of TACTIC. Many 3rd party
applications that communicate with TACTIC will produce unexpected
behavior when utilized in a fashion that was not intended for the
product, such as use in remote applications.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>TACTIC on public networks</strong></span></p><p>HTTP transport co-services can be configured to provide authentication
services to TACTIC.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>HTTP zone access</strong></span></p><p>The simplest form of HTTP security authentication zone access. To enable
different security scenarios, the HTTP service must be configured for
use of these scenarios. Configuration files (usually called .htaccess
files) contain a number of settings that can be used for integrating the
application with the capabilities of the Web server.</p><p>When enabling password zone access, the password is transmitted to the
server in cleartext, unless TLS is enabled.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Apache</strong></span></p><p>Apache uses either directives for directory access in the httpd.conf
file, or can be enabled on a per-directory basis, with the use of a
.htaccess file. Either way can be used. Apache provides modules for
LDAP, MySQL, flat-file, ADS, and many other authentication mechanisms.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>IIS</strong></span></p><p>IIS can be configured at the top level through the IIS snap-in, or by
individual configuration file. IIS 7 uses a file called Web.config to
hold settings for integration with applications. The Web.config file
contains information that control module loading, security
configuration, session state configuration, and application language and
compilation settings.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p><p>TACTIC can be configured to use the SSL transport layer. This layer is
independent of the TACTIC service, and can be tailored to the needs of
the deployment without major changes to the TACTIC service.</p><p>Both major HTTP servers can be configured for SSL support. There are
many materials online available for configuration of the various flavors
of these two major HTTP service projects.</p><p>Since there are many different versions of these servers, a simple
search of “Windows 2003 IIS SSL�? as an example will yield many HOWTOs
and configuration references. Please consult the documentation for these
services.</p><p>The configuration examples that have been set out below are by no means
complete. Depending on the HTTP service used, and the platform used,
these examples may not be enough set directives or steps to properly
complete the SSL process. They are given as guides.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Steps</strong></span></p><p>The major steps to utilizing SSL in with TACTIC are</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

double-click the Web Sites folder. 2. Right-click the Web site or file
that you want to protect with SSL, and then click Properties. 3. Under
Web site identification click Advanced. 4. In the Advanced Web site
identification box, under Multiple identities for this Web site, verify
that the Web site IP address is assigned to port 443, the default port
for secure communications, and then click OK. Optionally, to configure
more SSL ports for this Web site, click Add under Multiple identities of
this Web site, and then click OK. 5. On the Directory Security or File
Security tab, under Secure communications, click Edit. 6. In the Secure
Communications box, select the Require secure channel (SSL) check box.
7. To enable SSL client certificate authentication and mapping features,
select the Enable client certificate mapping check box, click Edit, add
the 1-to-1 or many-to-1 mappings you need, and then click OK three
times.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Secure transaction processing</strong></span></p><p>Processing transactions securely on the web means that there is a need
to be able to transmit information between the web site and the customer
in a manner that makes it difficult for other people to intercept and
read. SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, takes care of this. It works through
a combination of programs and encryption/decryption routines that exist
on the web services host, and in browser programs (like Firefox and
Internet Explorer)</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Performance</strong></span></p><p>TLS has encryption/decryption routines as part of its security. These
routines can be bandwidth/CPU intensive. Any usage of TLS can compromise
TACTIC, if the routines are incorporated into the same host as the
TACTIC service. See guides on load-balancing for details on offsetting
this.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p><p>A VPN will provide the most trouble-free access to TACTIC remotely. In
this scenario, the authentication/encryption routines are completely
removed from the realm of TACTIC configuration. This not only helps to
isolate TACTIC from complex configuration issues, but also allows for
isolated troubleshooting of remote access issues.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>PPTP</strong></span></p><p>PPTP is Microsoft supplied product. If an enterprise deployment of
TACTIC includes ADS authentication, then PPTP can be used as the VPN
transport layer. Usually, deployment is quite easily done. In PPTP,
usernames and passwords are used to complete the VPN link. PPTP can be
considered the “road-warrior�? VPN, meaning that it is easily deployed
to users.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>IPsec</strong></span></p><p>Ipsec is a suite of protocols used to secure data between hosts. A VPN
can be transported on top of this protocol. Typically, two remote hosts
are configured to communicate with each other, such as routers. This
type of VPN is typically used to connect two offices together.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Hardware VPNs</strong></span></p><p>Hardware VPNs such as offerings provided by companies like Cisco, can be
easily implemented. These Systems are designed for minimal ramp-up, and
can be implemented quickly.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Security Terms</strong></span></p><p>“is a form of active eavesdropping in which the attacker makes
independent connections with the victims and relays messages between
them, making them believe that they are talking directly to each other
over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is
controlled by the attacker. The attacker must be able to intercept all
messages going between the two victims and inject new ones, which is
straightforward in many circumstances (for example, an attacker within
reception range of an unencrypted Wi-Fi wireless access point, can
insert himself as a man-in-the-middle).�?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>SSL (Wikipedia)</strong></span></p><p>“Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols that provide security for
communications over networks such as the Internet. TLS and SSL encrypt
the segments of network connections at the Transport Layer end-to-end.�?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Cleartext (Wikipedia)</strong></span></p><p>Cleartext is transmitted, unencrypted text.</p><p>“In a cryptosystem, weaknesses can be introduced through insecure
handling of plaintext, allowing an attacker to bypass the cryptography

electronic or paper format. “</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>PPTP (wikipedia)</strong></span></p><p>The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a method for
implementing virtual private networks. PPTP uses a control channel over
TCP and a GRE tunnel operating to encapsulate PPP packets.</p><p>The PPTP specification does not describe encryption or authentication
features and relies on the PPP protocol being tunneled to implement
security functionality. However the most common PPTP implementation,
shipping with the Microsoft Windows product families, implements various
levels of authentication and encryption natively as standard features of
the Windows PPTP stack. The intended use of this protocol is to provide
similar levels of security and remote access as typical VPN products.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>IPSEC (Wikipedia)</strong></span></p><p>Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a protocol suite for securing
Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting
each IP packet of a data stream. IPsec also includes protocols for
establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of
the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to be used during the
session. IPsec can be used to protect data flows between a pair of hosts
(e.g. computer users or servers), between a pair of security gateways
(e.g. routers or firewalls), or between a security gateway and a
host.[1]</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_active_directory_integration"></a>6.3. Active Directory Integration</h3></div></div></div><p>TACTIC provides the ability to easily connect to any active directory
installation for both authentication and for synchronization of user
data. With a set of directives in the TACTIC configuration file, it is
possible to connect to Active Directory for authentication and user
information.</p><p>This synchronization takes place at login time. At this point, TACTIC
takes the desired information for a particular user and caches it into
the "sthpw/login" search type. Subsequent requests would normally use an
issued ticket given at login time. On these requests, no further
querying of active directory is needed until the ticket expires or the
user signs out the application.</p><p>The active directory modules make use of win32 libraries for python.
These must be installed in order for the connection to active directory
to function properly</p><p>There are a number of directives in the TACTIC config file that can be
used to configure the active directory settings. These allow you to
adjust TACTIC behavior to suit the needs of the facility.</p><p>In order to turn on active directory authentication, you must change the
authenticate class to the following:</p><p>authenticate_class: tactic.active_directory.ADAuthenticate</p><p>The following directives can be set under the active directory category:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>domains:</strong></span> This is a "|" delimited list of the domains that exist in the
network. If specified, a selection box for domains will be added to the
login page.</p><p>*allow:*can be "all", which allows everyone to log in if authentication
is approved or it can point to the name of a specific Active Directory
attribute that must be set to True. If a person is denied access, the
will receive the error: "Permission denied due to insufficient Active
Directory clearance".</p><p>*default_groups:*defines the default groups that a user will belong to
if none is specified. Multiple groups are delimited by "|".</p><p>*default_license_type:*determines the default license type for a user if
none is specified in the Active Directory attribute "tacticLicenceType".</p><p>Below is an example of a typical entry in the TACTIC config file:</p><p>&lt;active_directory&gt;</p><p>&lt;domains&gt;xxx|yyy|zzz&lt;/domains&gt;</p><p>&lt;allow&gt;tacticEnabled&lt;/allow&gt;</p><p>&lt;default_groups&gt;client&lt;/default_groups&gt;</p><p>&lt;default_license_type&gt;user&lt;/default_license_type&gt;</p><p>&lt;/active_directory&gt;</p><p>Allow anyone to login:</p><p>&lt;active_directory&gt;</p><p>&lt;allow&gt;all&lt;allow&gt;</p><p>&lt;/active_directory&gt;</p><p>Allow anyone to login and will be put in the "client" group if user has

TACTIC users lowercase with underscore separators for columns(
aaa_bbb_ccc). In order to maintain consistency within the TACTIC

provided. The following mappings are made by default:</p><div class="informaltable"><table cellpadding="4px" style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 3px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 3px solid #527bbd; border-left: 3px solid #527bbd; border-right: 3px solid #527bbd; " width="100%"><colgroup><col class="col_1" /><col class="col_2" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>mail</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>email</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>telephoneNumber</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>phone_number</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>department</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>department</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>displayName</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>first_name, last_name (broken up)</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>tacticLicenceType</p></td><td style="" align="left" valign="top"><p>license_type</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Active Directory variable "tacticLicenseType" is a custom variable
that indicates which type of license a particular user can occupy in
TACTIC. If this attribute is missing from a users active directory
profile, then they will be denied a login. This attribute can be used to
determine if a particular user in active directory is allowed to login
to TACTIC.</p><p>The only supported license for this attribute are "user" and "default".
Other license types have not yet been implemented yet.</p><p>On log in, TACTIC will look at all of the groups that a user belongs to
in Active Directory and match those group names to the "ad_login_group"
column in the "sthpw/login_group" search type. This grouping list will
synchronized at this time, removing the users from groups not specified
in Active Directory and add those that are specified. This means that
Active Directory is in full control of the groups that a user is part of
and therefore must be managed entirely in Active Directory.</p><p>For the name of the group, TACTIC only looks at the root of the path to
map the group name. For example, an active directory group with the
following distinguished name:</p><p>memberOf: CN=supervisor,OU=Users,OU=EIS,DC=domain,DC=us,DC=xxxx,DC=com</p><p>TACTIC will need only "supervisor" to be entered in the "ad_login_group"
column.</p><p>If on logging in, the number of users exceeds the number of users in the
license, then that user will be denied access and an entry in the
"sthpw/login" search type will not be made. However, all other users
currently registered can continue to work normally.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
