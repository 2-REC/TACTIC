            <p>Any application that is put on a public network can potentially be compromised, even
                with rigorous security testing. TACTIC, in its current version, has not been production
                           tested for security scenarios outside of completely trusted networks like intranets.
                           This document does not make any claims that TACTIC has any level of security beyond what
                           its current architecture design allows.

            <p>TACTIC is a bandwidth-intensive application, and client-server performance will be
                           affected by any number of network issues between the client and the server.
            </p>
            <p>There are numerous elements of functionality that go beyond utilizing HTTP port access
                           in enterprise applications of TACTIC. Many 3rd party applications that communicate with
                           TACTIC will produce unexpected behavior when utilized in a fashion that was not intended
                           for the product, such as use in remote applications.

            <p>HTTP transport co-services can be configured to provide authentication services to
                           TACTIC.

            <h4><a name="d0e4124"></a>HTTP zone access
            </h4>
            <p>The simplest form of HTTP security authentication zone access. To enable different
                           security scenarios, the HTTP service must be configured for use of these scenarios.
                           Configuration files (usually called .htaccess files) contain a number of settings that
                           can be used for integrating the application with the capabilities of the Web
                           server.
            </p>
            <p>When enabling password zone access, the password is transmitted to the server in
                           cleartext, unless TLS is enabled.
            </p>
            <h4><a name="d0e4130"></a>Apache
            </h4>
            <p>Apache uses either directives for directory access in the httpd.conf file, or can be
                           enabled on a per-directory basis, with the use of a .htaccess file. Either way can be
                           used. Apache provides modules for LDAP, MySQL, flat-file, ADS, and many other
                           authentication mechanisms.

            <p>IIS can be configured at the top level through the IIS snap-in, or by individual
                           configuration file. IIS 7 uses a file called Web.config to hold settings for integration
                           with applications. The Web.config file contains information that control module loading,
                           security configuration, session state configuration, and application language and
                           compilation settings.

            </h4>
            <p>TACTIC can be configured to use the SSL transport layer. This layer is independent of
                           the TACTIC service, and can be tailored to the needs of the deployment without major
                           changes to the TACTIC service.
            </p>
            <p>Both major HTTP servers can be configured for SSL support. There are many materials
                           online available for configuration of the various flavors of these two major HTTP
                           service projects.
            </p>
            <p>Since there are many different versions of these servers, a simple search of &#8220;Windows
                           2003 IIS SSL&#65533;? as an example will yield many HOWTOs and configuration references. Please
                           consult the documentation for these services.
            </p>
            <p>The configuration examples that have been set out below are by no means complete.
                           Depending on the HTTP service used, and the platform used, these examples may not be
                           enough set directives or steps to properly complete the SSL process. They are given as
                           guides.

                           &lt;security&gt;&lt;protocol&gt; directive must tell TACTIC to expect an SSL

            <p>To configure SSL on a Web server or a Web site</p>
            <p>1. In IIS Manager, double-click the local computer, and then double-click the Web
                           Sites folder. 2. Right-click the Web site or file that you want to protect with SSL, and
                           then click Properties. 3. Under Web site identification click Advanced. 4. In the
                           Advanced Web site identification box, under Multiple identities for this Web site,
                           verify that the Web site IP address is assigned to port 443, the default port for secure

            </h4>
            <p>Processing transactions securely on the web means that there is a need to be able to
                           transmit information between the web site and the customer in a manner that makes it
                           difficult for other people to intercept and read. SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, takes
                           care of this. It works through a combination of programs and encryption/decryption
                           routines that exist on the web services host, and in browser programs (like Firefox and
                           Internet Explorer)
            </p>
            <h4><a name="d0e4200"></a>Performance
            </h4>
            <p>TLS has encryption/decryption routines as part of its security. These routines can be
                           bandwidth/CPU intensive. Any usage of TLS can compromise TACTIC, if the routines are
                           incorporated into the same host as the TACTIC service. See guides on load-balancing for
                           details on offsetting this.

            <h4><a name="d0e4207"></a>Overview
            </h4>
            <p>A VPN will provide the most trouble-free access to TACTIC remotely. In this scenario,
                           the authentication/encryption routines are completely removed from the realm of TACTIC
                           configuration. This not only helps to isolate TACTIC from complex configuration issues,
                           but also allows for isolated troubleshooting of remote access issues.
            </p>
            <h4><a name="d0e4211"></a>PPTP
            </h4>
            <p>PPTP is Microsoft supplied product. If an enterprise deployment of TACTIC includes ADS
                           authentication, then PPTP can be used as the VPN transport layer. Usually, deployment is
                           quite easily done. In PPTP, usernames and passwords are used to complete the VPN link.
                           PPTP can be considered the &#8220;road-warrior&#65533;? VPN, meaning that it is easily deployed to
                           users.

            <h4><a name="d0e4215"></a>IPsec
            </h4>
            <p>Ipsec is a suite of protocols used to secure data between hosts. A VPN can be
                           transported on top of this protocol. Typically, two remote hosts are configured to
                           communicate with each other, such as routers. This type of VPN is typically used to
                           connect two offices together.

            <p>&#8220;is a form of active eavesdropping in which the attacker makes independent connections
                           with the victims and relays messages between them, making them believe that they are
                           talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire
                           conversation is controlled by the attacker. The attacker must be able to intercept all

                           many circumstances (for example, an attacker within reception range of an unencrypted
                           Wi-Fi wireless access point, can insert himself as a man-in-the-middle).&#65533;?

            <p>&#8220;Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are
                           cryptographic protocols that provide security for communications over networks such as
                           the Internet. TLS and SSL encrypt the segments of network connections at the Transport
                           Layer end-to-end.&#65533;?

            <p>&#8220;In a cryptosystem, weaknesses can be introduced through insecure handling of
                           plaintext, allowing an attacker to bypass the cryptography altogether. Plaintext is
                           vulnerable in use and in storage, whether in electronic or paper format. &#8220;

            <h4><a name="d0e4240"></a>PPTP (wikipedia)
            </h4>
            <p>The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a method for implementing virtual
                           private networks. PPTP uses a control channel over TCP and a GRE tunnel operating to
                           encapsulate PPP packets.
            </p>
            <p>The PPTP specification does not describe encryption or authentication features and
                           relies on the PPP protocol being tunneled to implement security functionality. However
                           the most common PPTP implementation, shipping with the Microsoft Windows product
                           families, implements various levels of authentication and encryption natively as
                           standard features of the Windows PPTP stack. The intended use of this protocol is to
                           provide similar levels of security and remote access as typical VPN products.

            <h4><a name="d0e4246"></a>IPSEC (Wikipedia)
            </h4>
            <p>Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol
                           (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a data stream.
                           IPsec also includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at
                           the beginning of the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to be used during the
                           session. IPsec can be used to protect data flows between a pair of hosts (e.g. computer
                           users or servers), between a pair of security gateways (e.g. routers or firewalls), or
                           between a security gateway and a host.[1]
