         <h4><a name="d0e3374"></a>Overview
         </h4>
         <p>Multiple TACTIC servers can be leveraged in environments where there is heavy report
            analysis, and where custom TACTIC environments are making heavy use of API and GUI calls. To
            spread out the load of the requests made, custom API scripts can be run on one TACTIC
            server, while another TACTIC server can be used to serve GUI requests. The only
                 consideration then with multiple TACTIC machines will be where the database and the asset
                    directories.
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e3378"></a>Database
         </h4>
         <p>TACTIC needs to know where to find assets and asset metadata. To do this, each
                    installation of TACTIC must be able to have direct file system access to assets storage, and
                    network access to the database co-service.
         </p>
         <p>tactic_(os).conf</p>
         <p>needs to contain this information.</p><pre class="screen">&lt;database&gt;
&lt;server&gt;[DB server IP]&lt;/server&gt;
&lt;/database&gt;
</pre><p>All other settings, covered previously, can be set according to individual requirements of
                    the host machine and environment.
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e3390"></a>Assets Storage
         </h4>
         <p>TACTIC needs to know where to find assets. To do this, each installation of TACTIC must be
                    able to have direct file system access to assets storage. The details of file system
                    management are beyond the scope of this document, but typically are within the realm of the
                    system administrator.
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e3394"></a>Processes
         </h4>
         <p>If the TACTIC server has no other services attached, there is probably room to increase
                    the number of processes running on each machine.
         </p><pre class="screen">&lt;services&gt;
&lt;process_count&gt;6&lt;/process_count&gt;
&lt;/services&gt;</pre><p>Refer to Reference: TACTIC Default Configuration for the complete sample configuration
                    file.

                    directives.

         </h4>
         <h4><a name="d0e3406"></a>Apache
         </h4>
         <p>Apache is used for the following sample HTTP configuration for TACTIC. Some configuration
                    knowledge of apache is required.
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e3410"></a>Permissions &#8211; Allowing TACTIC to store and manipulate assets
         </h4>
         <p>This section defines the location and availability of the assets directory, which is the
                    primary source of data for the apache server. There is also the declaration of an alias to
                    the TACTIC source directory, which contains various objects that TACTIC uses, such as widget
                    elements.
         </p><pre class="screen">Alias /context         /home/apache/tactic/src/context 
Alias /assets  		/home/apache/assets 
Alias /doc/  		  /home/apache/tactic/doc/ </pre><p>The section with &lt;Directory&gt; directives defines the access rules for the assets
                    directory and the "/tactic" directory, which is just a conveniently named alias.
         </p><pre class="screen">&lt;Directory "/home/apache/tactic" &gt;

&lt;/Directory&gt; </pre><h4><a name="d0e3420"></a>Proxying/Rewriting a single process &#8211; Redirecting requests to TACTIC
         </h4>
         <p>Apache needs to know where to find the proxied TACTIC service in the httpd.conf file. The
                    below configuration takes advantage of only one process being served from port 8081 on the
                    local machine.
         </p>
         <p>The second section, with RewriteRule directives, defines the re-write rules for the TACTIC
                    service, to segregate requests handled by the TACTIC server, from static asset delivery
                    through the HTTP service. These rules channel any requests that are prefixed with the
                    "/tactic" path to the TACTIC server on port 8081.
         </p><pre class="screen">RewriteRule   ^/tactic/(.+)$ http://localhost:8081/tactic/$1 [P,L]

</pre><h4><a name="d0e3428"></a>Proxying/Rewriting multiple processes &#8211; Redirecting requests to TACTIC
         </h4>
         <p>The proxy configuration can be enhanced with a load balancing scheme for one or more
                    machines. Apache has the ability to randomly select from a list of locations via a rewrite
                    map.
         </p><pre class="screen">RewriteMap    lb    rnd:/home/apache/sites/load_balance.txt</pre><p>This map can feed the rewrite rules with a dynamically assigned host name.</p><pre class="screen">RewriteRule   ^/tactic/(.+)$ http://${lb:dynamic}/tactic/$1    [P,L]
RewriteRule   ^/projects/(.+)$ http://${lb:dynamic}/tactic/$1  [P,L]
RewriteRule   ^/tactic http://${lb:dynamic}/tactic/            [P,L]
RewriteRule   ^/projects http://${lb:dynamic}/tactic/          [P,L]</pre><p>The file load_balance.txt is an arbitrarily named and located file that contains the names
                    of servers that will be referred to by the "rnd" function in the Rewrite rules. The
                    "lb:dynamic" reference will be replaced by the name of the server file
         </p>
         <p>The load_balance.txt contains a pipe separated list of hosts named "dynamic"</p><pre class="screen">dynamic	localhost:8081|localhost:8082|localhost:8083</pre><p>This list is dependent on the number of ports that TACTIC is running on, specified by
                    tactic_(OS).conf. Note that apache can proxy from IP addresses or hostnames external to the
                    host that the service is parked on.
         </p>
         <p>On this single line list, add all machines and ports that are running TACTIC. Since the
                    scheme algorithm is random, it does not matter what order the machines/ports are listed in,
                    just that they are actually on the list. In this case, there are multiple TACTIC machines,
                    named "tacticserver01" and "tacticserver02". The example assumes the machine has either DNS
                    entries for these machines or entries in the "hosts" file. IP addresses can also be
                    used.
         </p><pre class="screen">dynamic	tacticserver01:8081|tacticserver02:8081|tacticserver01:8082
# and so on, until all machines/ports are covered</pre><p>Refer to Reference: Apache Configuration for TACTIC for the complete sample configuration
                    file.

         <h4><a name="d0e3452"></a>Database Co-service Configuration
         </h4>
         <h4><a name="d0e3454"></a>PostgreSQL
         </h4>
         <p>PostgreSQL is used as the database co-service in the following sample configuration.
                    PostgreSQL has only two configuration files that are required to be examined in order to
                    function with TACTIC; pg_hba.conf and postgresql.conf
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e3458"></a>Network trust - pg_hba.conf
         </h4>
         <p>The pg_hba.conf configuration file contains a list of users and hosts with clearance
                    levels. In the default pg_hba.conf file that comes with TACTIC, the network trust level is
                    set for the most open access by the localhost;
         </p><pre class="screen"># TYPE  DATABASE    USER        CIDR-ADDRESS          METHOD 
local      all  all  trust 
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          trust 
# IPv6 local connections: 
host    all         all         ::1/128               trust 
</pre><p>In this example, all local connections to PostgreSQL are trusted. This configuration
                    matches the correct configuration required by a single machine.
         </p><pre class="screen">host   all     all  &lt;TACTIC_HOST_IP_ADDR&gt;     trust</pre><h4><a name="d0e3468"></a>Network interface - postgresql.conf. 
         </h4>
         <p>The postgresql.conf configuration file has a setting that will allow the PostgreSQL
                    service to bind to the particular interface required.
         </p>
         <p>Of concern is the "listen_addresses" attribute. </p><pre class="screen">listen_addresses = 'localhost' </pre><p>By default, the PostgreSQL service is only bound to the localhost. This is fine for single
                    machine operation of the TACTIC service.
         </p><pre class="screen">listen_addresses = '*' </pre><p>This setting or specific IP addresses can be used if the DB service is not on the same
                    machine as the TACTIC service
