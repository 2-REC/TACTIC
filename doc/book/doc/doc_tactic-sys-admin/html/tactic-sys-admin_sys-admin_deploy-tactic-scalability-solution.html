         <h4><a name="d0e24"></a> What Makes TACTIC Scalable?
         </h4>
         <p>The TACTIC platform uses web technologies in its underlying architecture. As proven by
                    many popular web sites today, web technologies are able to scale to a large number of
                    users&#8212;to levels far beyond the size of any large installation today requiring TACTIC.
         </p>
         <p>The TACTIC user interface and its API (Application Programmer Interface) are both built on
                    web technologies. A web server controls as the user front end., and accesses a back-end
                    database. Web servers can handle high volumes, so scalability is not an issue&#8212;especially for
                    the relatively manageable volume seen in even the largest of digital productions.
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e30"></a>Web server technology
         </h4>
         <p>TACTIC uses a web server to deliver static content to users, who are able to access TACTIC over the web. Web servers are capable
            of delivering enormous numbers of requests, and will remain stable during heavy loads.
                Web servers by definition are the most efficient vehicles for web delivery, and TACTIC technology is optimized to take
            advantage of this technology for fast execution and scalability. 
            
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e34"></a>    Leading database technology
         </h4>
         <p>TACTIC stores all persistent data in either Oracle or PostgreSQL databases, products that both have proven track records in
            the most demanding of production environments. 
         </p>
         <p>Today's databases coupled with today's hardware are sufficiently powerful to handle any of
                    today's production needs. The largest of digital productions cannot come close to exceeding
                    the data limits of a typical database. 
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e40"></a>    Optimized requests
         </h4>
         <p>With digital productions, the amount of data required is seldom the issue. Rather, bottlenecks
                    are typically caused by complex requests slowing down database response time. Digital
                    productions tend to use deeply nested and enormously complex relationships between various
                    pieces of data. It is this complexity that tends to slow down applications that try to parse
                    this data in a meaningful human way, creating complex requests that slow down database
                    response. 
         </p>
         <p>TACTIC is designed from the ground up to master the complexities of digital productions. For every request, it builds a unique
            object-relational mapper specifically designed for the needs of high volume, large scale digital production asset management
            solutions.
         </p>
         <p>TACTIC is flexible enough to handle the complex relationships between any part of the
                    production pipeline, and has proven itself in large-scale projects using extremely complex
                    data.

         <h4><a name="d0e48"></a>Easy code maintenance
            
         </h4>
         <p>The Python programming language is used for TACTIC application development. Python has many strengths that contribute to ease
            of maintenance (courtesy of www.python.org):

         <h4><a name="d0e83"></a>    Load balancing
         </h4>
         <p>Load balancing&#8212;the distribution of requests across TACTIC processes&#8212;is possible across cores and across multiple machines,
            and enables TACTIC to scale to large enterprise environments.
         </p>
         <p>(For details and examples, see <span class="bold"><strong>TACTIC Scalable Configuration

         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e92"></a>Segregating services 
         </h4>
         <p>The various TACTIC services can be segregated to run independently of each other. This allows important services, such as
            user interface requests, to access their own resources and not be slowed down by other more resource-intensive services such
            as render farms. 
         </p>

         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e101"></a>Types of Scalability
         </h4>
         <p>There are several types of scalability that are considerations with the use of Python as the TACTIC programming language:</p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
               <li class="listitem">
                  <p>Code scalability: TACTIC contains thousands of classes and many hundreds of thousands of lines of code which are facilitated
                     by use of the Python language.  There has been no reason to believe that the code base cannot continue to scale to meet software
                     needs for the foreseeable future.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li class="listitem">
                  <p>Memory scalability: Python is known for large memory requirements when compared to other languages, but the required memory
                     for TACTIC code is much smaller than that found on typical servers, and has seldom been an issue.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li class="listitem">
                  <p>Performance scalability: Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limits Python's scalability across multiple threads. This
                     limitation has been long discussed in newsgroups, with the general consensus that scalability is achieved much more easily
                     by load-balancing across processes rather than across threads. TACTIC enables easy load balancing across processes to achieve
                     full linear scalability.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li class="listitem">
                  <p>Maintenance scalability: Clean and clear syntax makes it easy to refactor and maintain code over the long term. Experience
                     has shown that our code base is very accessible to new developers, providing confidence that code base knowledge can be maintained
                     over the years.
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>Overall, very few limitations with the Python language itself have been encountered and have easily circumvented its lack
            of scalability across multiple threads by optimizing proper load balancing across processes.
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e120"></a>Additional Scalability Considerations
         </h4>
         <h4><a name="d0e122"></a>Availability
         </h4>
         <p>TACTIC has been designed to be highly stable even under extremely heavy stress. It has been tested and tuned on several projects
            in environments of high stress and high load and has been proven to run under duress without going down. 
         </p>
         <p>As with any piece of software, there is always a point a failure&#8212;there are a number of legitimate reasons for a TACTIC server
            becoming unresponsive or even going down:
         </p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
               <li class="listitem">
                  <p>network cutoff</p>
               </li>
               <li class="listitem">
                  <p>power failure</p>
               </li>
               <li class="listitem">
                  <p>physical memory failure</p>
               </li>
               <li class="listitem">
                  <p>overloaded requests for the available resources</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>For projects that require high availability even in the event of catastrophic failure, there are a number of hardware solutions
            to provide failover should the primary resource fail. These hardware solutions will instantly redirect requests to a redundant
            resource, thereby providing continuous service to the users.
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e143"></a>Memory requirements
         </h4>
         <p>Each available process will use a certain amount of memory, so a balance must be struck between the number of processes and
            the size of the complete in-memory TACTIC footprint on the server. In other words, adding more processes may or may not increase
            the availability of TACTIC if memory is an issue. If processes start running into swap space, performance will be severely
            affected.
         </p>
         <p>As memory usage becomes an issue, the choice will be to load balance over multiple machines
                    (see <span class="bold"><strong>Scalable TACTIC Deployments</strong></span>).
         </p>
         <h4><a name="d0e152"></a>Database Replication
         </h4>
         <p>Both Oracle and Postgres have replication capability: the ability to distribute the processing load of the database server
            over a number of machines. Database replication is complex and should not be taken lightly. With the advent of multiprocessor
            and multi-cores systems, the need for database replication has been reduced significantly. It is often much cheaper and less
            time consuming to increase the processors/cores of a server than it is to configure a database for replication.
