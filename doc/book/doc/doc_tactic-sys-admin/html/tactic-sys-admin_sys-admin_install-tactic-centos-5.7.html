         <p>It should be noted that while there may be newer versions of these Python modules, Tactic
                    3.6.0.v01 is built with these particular versions and may not work as intended should you
                    use later versions.

         <h3><a name="d0e782"></a>Disabling Security for Testing
         </h3>
         <p>For the sake of getting Tactic up quickly without a large amount of fuss, it is prudent to
                    disable firewalling and SELinux. This is by no means an endorsement to run your server
                    without these services. Once you have Tactic up and running we encourage you to read the
                    section &lt;TACTIC SECURITY&gt;.
         </p>
         <p>CentOS 5.7 uses the iptables service as a firewall. To disable this temporarily you can
                    issue the following commands as
                    root.
         </p><pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/iptables save
/etc/init.d/iptables stop</pre><p>This will disable the firewall for the currently running CentOS session. Should you wish
                    these settings to persist across reboots. You can issue the following command as
                    root.
         </p><pre class="screen">/sbin/chkconfig iptables off</pre><p>To disable SELinux, edit the file /etc/selinux/config as root with your favourite editor
                    and set the SELINUX variable to 'disabled'. 
         </p><pre class="screen">SELINUX=disabled</pre><p>Getting this setting to take effect requires a reboot.</p>
         <h3><a name="d0e800"></a>Installing Apache HTTP server
         </h3>
         <p>To install Apache 2.2 on CentOS 5.7 issue the following command as
                    root:
         </p><pre class="screen">yum install httpd</pre><p>This package has several dependencies and they should be installed as well. </p>
         <p>It would be good to familarize yourself with some of the more pertinent paths in the

         </div>
         <p>
                
         </p>
         <p>It's best to test your Apache install at this point. The included main Apache
                    configuration file is enough to get the server started. You will need create a small html
                    file to do this. Using your favourite editor create a file called index.html, including the
                    following
                    contents:
         </p><pre class="screen">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Apache Base Install&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Apache Install Successful&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre><p>Save the file in /var/www/html and issue the following command as root to ensure proper
                    permissions are set.
         </p><pre class="screen">chmod 755 /var/www/html/index.html</pre><p>Now we can start the Apache server itself. As root issue the following
                    command.
         </p><pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/httpd start</pre><p>The service should start successfully. If it does not consult the Apache error log listed
                    above to discover any problems that may have occured.
         </p>
         <p>At last we should now be able to point a web browser to the IP address associated with the
                    server.  If you see the text "Apache Install Successful", then your server is up and running
                    and server pages properly.  
         </p>
         <p>Finally we will want the Apache service to persist through reboots.  As root issue the
                    following command:
         </p><pre class="screen">/sbin/chkconfig httpd on</pre><p>Then reboot the server and make sure that httpd comes up on reboot and that you can view
                    the test page properly.  Later in the install we will configure the Apache server to
                    interact with Tactic properly.
         </p>
         <h3><a name="d0e863"></a>Installing Postgres Database Server
         </h3>
         <p>CentOS 5.7 repositories use Postgres version  8.1.23-1.  However Tactic requires version
                    8.4 or higher.  First we must make sure that we didn't include the default version Postgres
                    in our base install.  As root please issue the following
                    command:
         </p><pre class="screen">rpm -qva | grep -i postgres</pre><p>This command will search your installed
                    packages and filter the output for any packages containing the work postgres.  If you
                    receive any output from this command please uninstall the packages by issuing the following
                    command:
         </p><pre class="screen">rpm -e &lt;package_name&gt;</pre><p>Where &lt;package_name&gt; is the name of the package you wish to uninstall.  Consult the RPM
                    or Yum manpages for further instructions on installing and uninstalling packages.  
         </p>
         <p>Lastly before installing any new Postgres repository, we want to make sure to exclude the
                    default version of Postgres from showing up in the base and update Yum repositories included
                    with the operating system itself.  Using your favourite editor, edit the file
                    /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo to include the
                    line:
         </p><pre class="screen">exclude=postgresql*</pre><p>Under both the [base] section and the [updates] section of the file.  Save the file.  For
                    more information on the Yum installer and repository system please see the manpages for yum
                    or the yum website http://yum.baseurl.com 
         </p>
         <p>Once we have uninstalled any previous versions of Postgres, we can then proceed installing
                    a new Yum repository that contains the version of Postgres we want to install.  As root
                    issue the following
                    commands:
         </p><pre class="screen">cd /tmp
wget http://yum.pgrpms.org/9.1/redhat/rhel-5-i386/pgdg-centos-91-9.1-4.noarch.rpm
rpm -Uvh pgdg-centos-91-9.1-4.noarch.rpm</pre><p>At the time of writing the current version of Postgres was 9.1-4, for more current
                    installation versions please visit http://yum.pgrpms.org/repopackages.php and view the
                    available repository RPMs for your operating system and architecture.
         </p>
         <p>Lastly we will install the proper Postgres version 9.1 RPMs.  As root issue the following
                    command:
         </p><pre class="screen">yum install postgresql91 postgresql91-server postgresql91-devel</pre><p>Now that Postgres is installed we will do some basic configuration and testing to make
                    sure our installation is ready for use with Tactic.  
         </p>
         <p>Again we should first familiarize ourselves with the pertinent Postgres file paths that
                    will be used throughout the install:

         <p>If you have used the base postgresql-server install before you will notice that the above
                    paths are slightly different than the usual paths used on CentOS.  This install also varies
                    from the base install in that the user must manually initialize the databases used by
                    Postgres.  To do this issue the following command as root:
         </p><pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/postgresql-91 initdb</pre><p>Once that command successfully completes we can then start the service.  As root issue the
                    following command:
         </p><pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/postgresql-91 start</pre><p>If the service starts successfully we can move forward.  If not please view any startup
                    errors in the Postgres startup log.  Further troubleshooting help can be found at
                    http://postgresql.org,
         </p>
         <p>Lastly we will want to make sure the Postgres service persists through reboots.  As root
                    issue the following command:
         </p><pre class="screen">/sbin/chkconfig postgresql-91 on</pre><p>Reboot your server to ensure the service comes up appropriately.</p>
         <h3><a name="d0e941"></a>Installing Python 2.7
         </h3>
         <p>As noted above Tactic requires version 2.7 of Python.  CentOS comes with, and depends on
                    an earlier version of Python.  This means we simply can't remove Python from the system as
                    we did with Postgres.  We have to create a custom Python 2.7 install and keep it seperate
                    from the base install.
         </p>
         <p>First we need to install some development libraries and a compiler.  As root issue the
                    following command:
         </p><pre class="screen">yum install gcc zlib-devel libxslt-devel libxml2-devel</pre><p>Once those are installed we can get Python 2.7, as root issue the following
                    command:
         </p><pre class="screen">cd /tmp
wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/Python-2.7.1.tgz
tar -zxvf Python-2.7.1.tgz
cd Python-2.7.1
./configure --prefix=/opt/python2.7
make &amp;&amp; make install</pre><p>This will install Python 2.7 in the custom path /opt/python2.7.  You can choose a
                    different custom install directory should you choose. 
         </p>
         <h3><a name="d0e955"></a>Installing Python 2.7 Modules
         </h3>
         <p>Next we will install the necessary Python 2.7 modules.  These provide extended
                    functionality to the Python environment.   Before we begin however we will have to set an
                    environment variable such that the Python 2.7 modules we are installing can find their link
                    dependencies.  In the BASH shell environment as root issue the following
                    command:
         </p><pre class="screen">export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/python2.7/lib</pre><p>This will prefix your link dependency library path with our custom python libaries
                    ensuring they get precedence in the installation of the modules.  This environment variable
                    only exists for the current shell environment.  Any new shells you open will need to have
                    this variable set as well.  We will institute a permanent solution to this problem
                    later.

         <p>The installer will ask you a number of questions.  You should be prompted by the

         </p><pre class="screen">Please enter the base path of the TACTIC installation:

(/home/apache) -&gt; /opt/tactic</pre><p>Choose your custom Tactic path, this will be the base directory for your Tactic

                    service.
         </p><pre class="screen">Please enter the user Apache Web Server is run under:

(apache) -&gt;</pre><p>In many cases the default user "apache" is correct. However you can verify this easily in

                    "apache" so we will accept the default the installer gives us.
         </p>
         <p>The installer will then install the Tactic databases, configure Tactic and copy the source
                    code into the Tactic base directory.

                    during the installation process.  As root issue the following

         <p>Lastly we will create a redirect for Tactic using the index.html file at the document root
                    of the Apache server.  Using your favourite editor as root, edit the file
                    /var/www/html/index.html to contain only the following

         <p>You can use the key combination CTRL+c in the shell running the Tactic Development mode
                    service to stop  it when you are ready
         </p>
         <p>The Tactic service file is simple to install, however due to the custom Python pathing we
                    have used we have edit the Tactic service file to reflect those changes. As root, using your
                    favourite editor open the file /opt/tactic/tactic/src/install/service/tactic and make the
                    following changes.
         </p>
         <p>The Python environment variable PYTHON should be set to the path of our custom Python
                    binary.
         </p><pre class="screen">PYTHON=/opt/python2.7/bin/python2.7</pre><p>Additionally we want to setup the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to include our custom Python
                    libraries.  Under the following line:
         </p><pre class="screen">export PYTHON</pre><p>Add the following lines
                    to the
                    file:
         </p><pre class="screen">LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/python2.7/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH</pre><p>Lastly, Tactic startup uses the same mechanism as Developer mode, however this is not yet
                    reflected in the Tactic service file. Change the following
                    line:
         </p><pre class="screen">su - $TACTIC_USER -m -c "$LAUNCH" &gt;&gt; $LOG 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</pre><p>To

         <p>One last Python path must be corrected before we install the Tactic service. During
                    installation Tactic created a file that you will become more familiar with throughout your
                    use of Tactic. That file is /opt/tactic/projects/config/tactic_linux-conf.xml. Using your
                    favourite editor as root edit this file. Find the following
                    line:
         </p><pre class="screen">&lt;python&gt;python&lt;/python&gt;</pre><p>And replace it

         </p><pre class="screen">&lt;python&gt;/opt/python2.7/bin/python2.7&lt;/python&gt;</pre><p>Save the file.</p>
         <p>Now we will install the Tactic service.  As root type the
                    following:
         </p><pre class="screen">cp /opt/tactic/tactic/src/install/service/tactic /etc/init.d/tactic
