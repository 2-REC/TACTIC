         <h3><a name="d0e1303"></a>Disabling Security for Testing
         </h3>
         <p>To get TACTIC up quickly without fiddling with OS security, it is prudent to disable
                    firewalling and SELinux. This is by no means an endorsement to run your server without these
                    services. Once you have TACTIC up and running,  you are advised to read the section
                    &lt;TACTIC SECURITY&gt;.
         </p>
         <p>CentOS 6.2 uses the iptables service as a firewall. To disable this temporarily, you can
                    issue the following commands as
                    root.
         </p><pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/iptables save
/etc/init.d/iptables stop</pre><p>This will disable the firewall for the currently running CentOS session. Should you wish
                    these settings to persist across reboots, you can issue the following command as
                    root.
         </p><pre class="screen">/sbin/chkconfig iptables off</pre><p>To disable SELinux, edit the file /etc/selinux/config as root with your editor of choice
                    and set the SELINUX variable to 'disabled'. 
         </p><pre class="screen">SELINUX=disabled</pre><p>Since getting this setting to take effect requires a reboot, you can also issue the
                    following command for it to take effect immediately.
         </p><pre class="screen">echo 0 &gt; /selinux/enforce</pre><p></p>
         <h3><a name="d0e1324"></a>Installing Apache HTTP server
         </h3>
         <p>In case Apache 2.2  is not already pre-installed on CentOS 6.2, issue the following
                    command as root:
         </p><pre class="screen">yum install httpd</pre><p>This package has several dependencies and they should be installed as well. </p>

         <p> It's best to test your Apache install at this point. The included main Apache
                    configuration file is enough to get the server started. You will need create a small html
                    file to do this. Using your editor of choice, create a file called index.html, with the
                    content as
                    follows:
         </p><pre class="screen">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Apache Base Install&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Apache Install Successful&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre><p>Save the file in /var/www/html and issue the following command as root to ensure proper
                    permissions are set:
         </p><pre class="screen">chmod 755 /var/www/html/index.html</pre><p>The Apache server can be started. As root, issue the following
                    command:
         </p><pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/httpd start</pre><p>The service should start successfully. Otherwise, consult the Apache error log listed
                    above to discover any problems that may have occured.
         </p>
         <p>At last, you can point a web browser to the IP address associated with the server. If you
                    see the text "Apache Install Successful", then your server is up and running and can serve
                    pages properly. 
         </p>
         <p>Finally, to make the Apache service persist through reboots, issue the following command
                    as root:
         </p><pre class="screen">/sbin/chkconfig httpd on</pre><p>Then reboot the server and make sure that httpd comes up on reboot and that you can view
                    the test page properly. Later in the install,  the Apache server will be configured to
                    interact with TACTIC properly.
         </p>
         <h3><a name="d0e1397"></a>Installing Postgres Database Server
         </h3>
         <p>TACTIC requires PostgreSQL version 8.4 or higher. First we must make sure that we didn't
                    include the default version Postgres in our base install. As root please issue the following
                    command:
         </p><pre class="screen">rpm -qva | grep -i postgres</pre><p>This command will search your installed
                    packages and filter the output for any packages containing the work postgres. If you receive
                    any output from this command please uninstall the packages by issuing the following
                    command:
         </p><pre class="screen">rpm -e &lt;package_name&gt;</pre><p>Where &lt;package_name&gt; is the name of the package you wish to uninstall.  Consult the RPM
                    or Yum manpages for further instructions on installing and uninstalling packages.  
         </p>
         <p>Lastly before installing any new Postgres repository, we want to make sure to exclude the
                    default version of Postgres from showing up in the base and update Yum repositories included
                    with the operating system itself. Using a text editor, edit the file
                    /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo to include the line under both the [base] section and the
                    [updates] section of the file. :
         </p><pre class="screen">exclude=postgresql*</pre><p>Save the file. For more information on the Yum installer and repository system please see
                    the manpages for yum or the yum website http://yum.baseurl.com 
         </p>
         <p>Once we have uninstalled any previous versions of Postgres, we can then proceed installing
                    a new Yum repository that contains the version of Postgres we want to install. As root issue
                    the following
                    commands:
         </p><pre class="screen">rpm -Uvh http://yum.postgresql.org/9.2/redhat/rhel-6-x86_64/pgdg-centos92-9.2-6.noarch.rpm</pre><p>At the time of writing the current version of Postgres was 9.2-6, for more current
                    installation versions please visit http://yum.pgrpms.org/repopackages.php and view the
                    available repository RPMs for your operating system and architecture.
         </p>
         <p>Lastly, we will install the proper Postgres version 9.2 RPMs. As root, issue the following
                    command:
         </p><pre class="screen">yum install postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-contrib postgresql-devel</pre><p>Now that Postgres is installed, you are advised to make some basic configuration to make
                    sure the installation is ready for use with TACTIC. 
         </p>
         <p>Here are the pertinent Postgres file paths that will be used throughout the install: </p>

         </h3>
         <p>First we have to download the TACTIC source from the Southpaw Community website. Using a
                    web browser navigate to http://community.southpawtech.com. After you have logged in, please
                    click on "Downloads" in the upper right hand corner of the website. Once you are on the
                    downloads page, you should see the download link for the latest TACTIC Enterprise. Save the
                    TACTIC Enterprise zip file in /tmp on the server. 
         </p>
         <p>Once we have the Tactic source we need to unpack it. As root issue the following
                    commands:
         </p><pre class="screen">cd /tmp
unzip tactic-3.9.0.rc04.zip</pre><p>Once the TACTIC source is unpacked, you should familarize yourself with its directory
                    structure. The prefix of the paths will change during install; however, the directory
                    structure will remain the same.

         <p>Before we run the Tactic installer, we must further configure Postgres to ensure proper
                    installation of Tactic.
         </p>
         <h5><a name="d0e1613"></a>Configuring Postgres
         </h5>
         <p>Tactic supplies a custom host based authentication file for Postgres. After stopping the
                    Postgres service we will install the file in question, restart the service and verify that
                    the configuration has been properly put in place. As root issue the following
                    commands:
         </p><pre class="screen">service postgresql-9.2 stop
mv /var/lib/pgsql/9.2/data/pg_hba.conf /var/lib/pgsql/9.2/data/pg_hba.conf.INSTALL

service postgresql-9.2 start</pre><p>If the service starts successfully we can then proceed to verification. If not please
                    consult the Postgres startup log for error information. Postgres must be running as a
                    service during the Tactic install. Next we will test the install.  As root, issue the
                    following command:

         </p>
         <p>The installer will ask you a number of questions.  You should be prompted by the
                    following:
         </p><pre class="screen">Please enter the base path of the TACTIC installation:

(/home/apache) -&gt; /opt/tactic</pre><p>Choose your custom Tactic path, this will be the base directory for your Tactic
                    installation.  We have chosen /opt/tactic.  Next you will be asked to identify the user used
                    to run the Apache
                    service.
         </p><pre class="screen">Please enter the user Apache Web Server is run under:

(apache) -&gt;</pre><p>In many cases the default user "apache" is correct.  However you can verify this easily in
                    another shell by issueing the following command as root:
         </p><pre class="screen">ps -ef | grep httpd</pre><p>The first column of output is the username Apache is running under. Should you receive no
                    output, make sure your httpd service is running. Under CentOS 6.2 the apache user is
                    "apache" so we will accept the default the installer gives us.
         </p>
         <p>The installer will then install the Tactic databases, configure Tactic and copy the source
                    code into the Tactic base directory.
         </p>
         <h5><a name="d0e1652"></a>Configuring
                        Apache
         </h5>
         <p>Lastly Tactic requires us to install the custom Apache configuration file it has created
                    during the installation process. As root issue the following
                    commands:
         </p><pre class="screen">cp /opt/tactic/tactic_data/config/tactic.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d</pre><p>To test this we should first verify that /etc/httpd/conf.d is an included module path in
                    the main Apache configuration file.  As root issue the following
                    command:
         </p><pre class="screen">cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep conf.d</pre><p>If you receive the following as output we have installed the Tactic Apache configuration
                    file correctly.
         </p><pre class="screen">Include conf.d/*.conf</pre><p>If you do not receive this output, using your editor as root edit the file
                    /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and at the bottom of the file insert the statement listed above.
                    Save the file.
         </p>
         <p>Lastly we will create a redirect for Tactic using the index.html file at the document root
                    of the Apache server. Using a text editor as root, edit the file /var/www/html/index.html to
                    contain only the following
                    line:
         </p><pre class="screen">&lt;META http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL=/tactic"&gt;</pre><p>Restart the Apache service to make sure the configuration hasn't caused any problems.  As
                    root issue the following command:
         </p><pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/httpd restart</pre><p>Lastly we need to ensure that the Apache server has loaded the modules needed for proxying
                    and load balancing the Tactic service.  As root issue the following
                    command:
         </p><pre class="screen">/usr/sbin/httpd -t -D DUMP_MODULES</pre><p>In the resulting output look for the following
                    modules:
         </p><pre class="screen">rewrite_module (shared)
proxy_module (shared)
proxy_http_module (shared)

         <p>We are now prepared to start the Tactic service for the first time.   Tactic must be run
                    as the Apache user.  Usually we would su to the apache user, however since its a system
                    account without a login this will not work without optionally telling su to give the Apache
                    user a shell environment.  In a shell with the LD_LIBRARY_PATH set as laid out in the
